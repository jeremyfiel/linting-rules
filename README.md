# Linting Rules
This is a proof of concept for managing linting rules that can be used via a linting API as well natively as a collection in a modular way that can be can be evolve using Github.

**URL:** https://postman-open-technologies.github.io/linting-rules/

You can apply these rules using a variety of methods, helping realize linting at different stages of the API lifecycle:

- **[Linting API](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/OpenAPI-Linting~f8227475-4001-406c-b048-78ab9035ae1d/documentation/12959542-93cd90de-9f3c-4ed0-9c57-cc5a7712cf19)** - An open source API for posting an OpenAPI and link to rules to lint an OpenAPI at any point along the API lifeycle.
- **[Linting Script](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/OpenAPI-Linting~f8227475-4001-406c-b048-78ab9035ae1d/documentation/12959542-54a0882f-a8df-44ec-9861-40e409ca9876) - A pure collection based approach to linting an OpenAPI using Postman test scripts, removing the needed for a backend.


If you have any questions about rules you can submit an issue or start a discussion within this repo, and if you have specific questions about applying rules as part of the API lifecycle you can comment on one of the collections in the [OpenAPI Linting workspace](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/OpenAPI-Linting~f8227475-4001-406c-b048-78ab9035ae1d/overview).
