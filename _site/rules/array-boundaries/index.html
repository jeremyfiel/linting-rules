{"name": "","description": "Array size should be limited to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks. This can be done using `maxItems` and `minItems`, like in the example below. You should ensure that the schema referenced in  `items` is constrained too. If you delegate input validation to a library or framework, be sure to test it thoroughly and ensure that it verifies `maxItems`."}
