Error management is a key enabler of a resilient API ecosystem.
Enforcing a consistent schema for errors between different APIs,
enables client to properly implement an error management strategy,
with positive impacts for users.

This rule inspects the schema returned by an error response and
verifies whether it contains the main properties defined in RFC7807:
`status`, `title` and `detail`.

An example of a valid payload is
```
{
"title": "Not Found",
"status": 404,
"detail": "Book does not exist; id: 123"
}
```
