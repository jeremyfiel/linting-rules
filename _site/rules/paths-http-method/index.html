{"name": "","description": "When you design a REST API, you don&#39;t usually need to mention terms like
`get`, `delete` and so on in your `paths`, because this information is
conveyed by the HTTP method. This simplifies securing your API as you know beforehand the kind of action
which is going to be performed."}
