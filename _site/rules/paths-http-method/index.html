        "description": "When you design a REST API, you don't usually need to mention terms like `get`, `delete` and so on in your `paths`, because this information is conveyed by the HTTP method. Instead of using ``` POST /books/1234/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example ``` You can simply call ``` DELETE /books/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example
``` Similarly you don't need verbs like `list` or `create` because the HTTP Semantics RFC7231 supports this kind of actions natively with proper methods and status code. Instead of ```
POST /create/user HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example
Content-Type: application/json
{"given_name": "Mario"}
``` You can use ```
POST /create/user HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example
Content-Type: application/json
{"given_name": "Mario"}
``` returning a proper response ``` HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /users/1234 ``` This simplifies securing your API as you know beforehand the kind of action which is going to be performed.",
