[see API4:2019 Lack of Resources &amp; Rate Limiting](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security).

APIs should use the following headers at least on successful responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: number of total requests in a give time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: remaining requests in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: number of seconds before the window resets

A standardization proposal for ratelimit headers is ongoning
inside the IETF HTTPAPI Workgroup.
