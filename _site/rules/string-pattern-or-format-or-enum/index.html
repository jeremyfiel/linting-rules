{"name": "","description": "String length should be limited to avoid an attacker
to send very long strings to your service.

You can do this in different ways:
- specify a `maxLength`
- constraint the possible values with an `enum`
- use a constrained `format` like `date` or `date-time`.

A constrained string using the `date` format.

For further security, you can always limit string length even
in conjunction with `format` and `pattern`."}
